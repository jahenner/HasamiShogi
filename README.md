# Hasami Shogi CS162 Portfolio Project

This project was the Portfolio Project for my CS162 class. I have since updated to give it a GUI and currently working on making an AI to play against. I will be further working on this project to make it networked, so others can play from around the world.

The original requirements for this project were to just make a playable game, where 2 players can input legal moves. 

It was hard to visualize where all the pieces were at any given time, so I created a way to pretty print the board.

This was tremendous help to find all the edge cases and test them out.

After it was turned in with the given requirements I started to implement pygame. I have worked in pygame before, so I didn't have any major implementation issues.
Here is the first run of the GUI.

I then wanted to have a visualization of possible moves, so I made the possible locations a green square.

After getting all of the game play on the GUI down, I started to add some textures to the board and pieces.

My favorite part about this was the wood tiles. I implemented a random feature that would flip and rotate each tile, to make it look different and more like a board would look.

My current part of this project that I am trying to implement is to be able to play against an AI. So far I have just made it so the AI will make random legal moves.
